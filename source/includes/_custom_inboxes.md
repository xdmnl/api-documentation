# Custom inboxes

A custom inbox let you control how messages are received and sent via HTTP calls.
You can use custom inboxes to integrate Front with channels that are not officially supported.

## Create a custom inbox

* Go to Settings > Inboxes
* Click on "Create an inbox" and choose the **Custom** type
* Choose a name for your inbox
* Define a callback URL

## Receive messages

See [Receive an incoming message](#receive-an-incoming-message) endpoint documentation.

## Sending messages

> In case of a teammate sending a message, this is what the request body your endpoint would receive:

```json

  ],
  "body": "Anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time.",
  "text": "Anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time.",
  "attachments": [],

}
```

Whenever a message is sent from Front (either by a rule or by a teammate), a **POST** HTTP request will be issued to the callback URL you defined. The request body will contain the data of the message sent just like if fetched it.
