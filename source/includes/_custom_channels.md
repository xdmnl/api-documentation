# Custom channels

A custom channel lets you control how messages are received and sent via HTTP calls.
You can use custom channels to integrate Front with platforms that are not officially supported.

## Create a custom channel

* Go to Settings > Inboxes
* Click on "Add an inbox" and choose the **Custom** type
* Choose a name for your inbox
* Define a callback URL
* Define the contact type, reply mode and compose mode for the custom channel. 
  * The contact type can only be set on channel creation.

## Receive messages

See [Receive a custom message](#receive-custom-message) endpoint documentation.

## Sending messages

> In case of a teammate sending a message, this is what the request body your endpoint would receive:

```

Whenever a message is sent from Front (either by a rule or by a teammate), a **POST** HTTP request will be issued to the callback URL you defined. The request body will contain the data of the message sent just like if fetched it.

The request body will be signed using your API secret so you can validate that it came from Front (cf: [Checkin data integrity](#checking-data-integrity)).
