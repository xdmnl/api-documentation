## Exports [/exports/{export_id}]

Front can generate exports of your data for a specific timeframe and/or specific inboxes, teammates or tags.

Since an export takes some time to process, it has a `status` which can be either:

* `pending` when the export is still generating
* `done` once the export has been generated
* `failed` in case the generation failed

Once the export has been generated, you can download it with its `url`.

### Format

Exports are formatted as a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files. The export will contain 1 line per message received in the given time period.

**If a message appears in multiple inboxes, it will appear once for each inbox**.

Below is a table of the field names & descriptions that will be included in the export.

**Timezone**

All dates in the export are presented in the same timezone. If the export was requested from the app (by clicking on "Request Export"), it will be in the timezone of the user. If the export is requested with the API, the timezone can be manually defined (or defaults to UTC).

**Response time**

Response time is always calculated from the point of view of a customer: how did it take for your company to reply?

Most of the time, the response time is the difference between an inbound message from a customer and the next reply from your team.

If your team replies several times to the same message, the response time is the time since the previous reply.

**Assignments and Handle time**

Most of the time, only one discussion happens within a conversation. That is: a customer will open a conversation to ask a specific thing and if they want to ask another one, they will open a new discussion.

However, this is not always the case:

* A customer might decide to reply to an existing conversation even if they are asking for something new.
* Several teammates might write in one conversation.

Because of this, Front will compute a **handle time** to the last message if:

* the conversation is reassigned to a different teammate.
* the conversation is inactive for **4 days**.
