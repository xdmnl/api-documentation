# Introduction

## Getting started

You can create a new developer account by registering [at this link](https://frontapp.com/signup?affiliate=developers).

If you are already a Front customer, read our [How to create and revoke API tokens](https://help.frontapp.com/t/36dsxd/how-to-create-and-revoke-api-tokens) guide for information on how to generate an API token, and get started with Front's API.

## Authentication

```http
GET /teammates HTTP/1.1
Host: api2.frontapp.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

> You should replace "`<token>`" in the example above by your JSON Web Token.

The API uses [JSON Web Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) to authenticate its user.

You **MUST** send the token for each request in the **Authorization** header. The token **MUST** be preceeded by `Bearer `

You can get your JSON web token directly from Front (go to > Plugins & API > API).

## Content type

```http
POST /channels/{channel_id}/messages HTTP/1.1
Host: api2.frontapp.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{}
```

The API is designed to communicate with your server using JSON. All responses coming from the API will send data in a valid JSON object.
If you need to send data to the API, your request **SHOULD** set the `Content-Type` HTTP header to `application/json`.

Some endpoints also support multipart requests for file upload. For more details about it, please check our [multipart request](#send-multipart-request) documentation.

## Limitations

### Rate limiting

By default, the API is limited to 100 requests in 60 seconds. If you need to increase your API rate limit, your team admins can upgrade your access  by purchasing the "Raise API limit" add-on via your Settings > Billing page.

Every response will contains three headers related to the rate-limiting:

> Example of a response to a request exceeding the rate limit. The client should wait 20s before resending the request.

```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1454450858
Retry-After: 20
```

| Name                      | Description                                                           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`       | Maximum number of request allowed in the time window                  |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining`   | Current remaining number of requests in the current time window       |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`       | Next timestamp when the number of remaining requests will be reset    |


When the rate limit is exceeded, the server will respond with a [**429 Too Many Requests**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4) HTTP code with the header `Retry-After` to tell you how many seconds you need to wait before you can retry the request.

### Additional Rate limiting
Some resource intensive routes are subject to additional rate limiting to prevent strain on Front's infrastructure. This additional rate limit has a short TTL and only prevents sudden bursts of requests. The limit will depend on the resources needed to fulfill the request.

Such routes have the header `X-Front-Tier`. If you are rate limited for such a route, you will receive the header `Retry-After`, even though `X-RateLimit-Remaining` may be greater than 0. This is because the limits do not affect each other.

Please wait `Retry-After` seconds before safely retrying the request.

If you experience any difficulties, please <a href='mailto:api@frontapp.com'>contact us</a>.

### Individual resources

By default, individual resources are private and the API does not let you interact with them nor with their content.
However, a user has the ability to allow access to their individual resources from the API in their settings (cf: Settings > My preferences).

<aside class="notice">Individual resources are accessible only to tokens that have been generated by Front. OAuth clients are not authorized to access them.</aside>

## Resource aliases

You can refer to all the resources with their IDs. Alternatively, some resources can be accessed via a more human readable alias:

* [Teammates](#teammates) can be identified with their `email`.
* [Channels](#channels) can be identified with their `address`.
* [Contacts](#contacts) can be identified with one of their `source` and `handle`.
* [Messages](#messages) can be identified with their `uid`.

If you want to use an alternative alias, you **MUST** prefix it with `alt:` and the name of the value used to identify the resource.
Examples:

* `alt:email:leela@planet-express.com` for the teammate with the email address *leela@planet-express.com*.
* `alt:address:@FrontApp` for the channel with the address *@FrontApp*.
* `alt:twitter:@leela` for the contact having the twitter handle *@leela*.
* `alt:phone:+12345678900` for the contact having the phone number *+12345678900*.
* `alt:uid:3b1q41d8` for the message with the uid *3b1q41d8*.

## Dates

All dates in the Front API are encoded as a number representing Unix time: It is the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1st 1970.

Since Front is based on events that can occur during the same second, all the timestamps include leap seconds with a precision of 3 digits: `1454453901.012`.

## Search parameters

For some requests to get a large collection of resources, you can send search criteria in the query string via a parameter named `q`.

> Fetch all conversations deleted and assigned:

```http
GET /conversations?q[statuses][]=deleted&q[statuses][]=assigned HTTP/1.1
Host: api2.frontapp.com
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Search criteria for conversations

| Name       | Type             | Description                                                                                                               |
|------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `statuses` | array (optional) | List of the statuses of the conversations you want to list. <br>Can be 'assigned', 'unassigned', 'archived' or 'deleted'  |

```

### Search criteria for events

| Name     | Type              | Description                                              |

|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `updated_before` | number (optional) | Timestamp of the max date of the last update |
| `updated_after`  | number (optional) | Timestamp of the min date of the last update |

## Response body structure

A JSON object will be at the root of every responses body. When requesting a resource collections, the collection will be encapsulated in a `_results` field.

A response will contain at least one of the following top-level members:

* `_pagination`: An object containing pagination information.
* `_links`: An object containing the resource links for self-discoverability.
* `_error`: An array of [error objects](#error).

### Pagination

When listing a large number of resources, the API server will return a limited number of results.
When this is the case, the JSON response will contain a field named `_pagination`.

| Name      | Type              | Description                       |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `prev`    | string (optional) | URL of the previous page          |
| `next`    | string (optional) | URL of the next page              |


### Links

To improve the self-discoverability of our API, every resources contains a `_links` object:

| Name      | Type              | Description                                   |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `self`    | string            | URL of the resource                           |
| `related` | object (optional) | Object listing the URL of related resources   |

### Error

When the response is an error, its body will contain an `_error` object to describe the error.

An error object looks like this:

| Name      | Type      | Description                               |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `status`  | number    | HTTP status code applicable to the error  |
| `title`   | string    | Human-readable summary of the problem     |
| `message` | string    | Human-readable explanation of the error   |
| `details` | array     | List of string detailing the error        |
